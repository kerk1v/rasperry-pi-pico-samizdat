<h1>Welcome to my Samizdat</h1>
According to Wikipedia a samizdat is a "self-published work of dissident literature, which was clandestinely distributed in the former Soviet bloc countries."  <br>
This is my own personal samizdat.  I will be posting my own personal thoughts and ideas here.  I will also be posting links to other sites that I find interesting.  I hope you enjoy it.<br>

As I'm not really trying to hide who I am, the source code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/kerk1v/rasperry-pi-pico-samizdat">here</a> <br>
It runs on a cheap Single-Board-Computer (also known as microcontroller) with WLAN like a Raspberry Pi Pico, an ESP8266 or an ESP32. <br>
All of these listed above have MicroPython available, so this small fun project should run on all of them.<br>
All these devices are quite power efficient so they can run for many hours, even for a day or more with a rechargeable 18650 Li-Ion cell or on primary cells.<br>
<br>
Imagine the potential uses: <br>
- Publish a guerrilla-style news page.<br>
- Provide some information at a public place. <br>
- Dead letter box for conspirative activities. <br>
